========

some materials for the "from 0 to C" Computer Science / Code Class

I'll slowly keep adding more resources in hope that people start picking it up.
you'll find a draft from the program we wrote for a school in 2012, but it's not up-to-date.
good to get an idea of how I structure this class.




requirements:
[NodeBox][_link_nodebox]

[Illustrator][_link_illustrator, [InkScape][_link_inkscape], [Affinity Designer][_link_affinity] or other vector graphics app which supports the _.ai_ file format
